Step 1: Approve the New Version (Manual)
Before the deployment script can pick it up, you must tell AWS this new version is valid.

Go to AWS Console > SageMaker > Model Registry.

Click on FredRecessionModels.

Click on Version 3 (the one just created).

Click Update Status (top right) → Select Approved → Save.

Step 2: Retry Deployment
Now run the deployment script again. It will automatically find the latest approved model (Version 3) and deploy it.
